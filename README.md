## üé≠ Change your path

Origins Transgender is a thoughtful addon for the Origins mod that introduces the ability for your character to change their origin through an ancient and meaningful ritual

## ‚ú® Key Feature: The Ritual of origin
This is not just a simple command or an item. It is a special ritual that requires you to:

Create a altar.
Create rare and symbolic ingredients representing purification and change.
Perform a ceremony that will permanently transform your origin.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Dependencies:
For the mod to work, you need:

- Origins (the core mod)
- Create (for the mechanical elements of the ritual)
- Additional libraries of origins.
